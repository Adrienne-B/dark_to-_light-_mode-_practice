Dark mode to Light mode using Javascript

# Summary 
This was a mini practice on creating a dark to light mode switch using javascript

### Description/ walk-through
At first glance, the image of a woman will capture your eye. As you scroll down the home page, you will see where you can type in your name to 
sign in to the website. Once you get to the feature section, there will be logos on top of the small description. The cool part is when you
minimize the screen, it will be one column. As you widen the screen the columns become two and, once it gets to full width, there will be 
three columns and two rows. I had to use flexbox but, the outcome made the homepage that much more professional-looking. 

#### Software used:
CodeSandBox

#### What I learn:
When there are two buttons I do not need to use the if else if statements.

##### Challenges to improve on
1.Using If if else statements with one button and two buttons


##### Solutions/solving the issue:
I was able to keep it simple with no if if else statements
